  <p><b>14.3 Task Details</b></p>

  <p><b>14.3.1 Recording the complaint</b></p>

<p>Customer complaint could be sent to the PM directly through email or through any other mode of normal communication with the customer. Customer complaints also come through Customer Satisfaction Survey and the interactions with the sales representative of the project. In any case, the complaint will be recorded using <u><a href='downloads/projectProcedures/FRVER04.xls' download>Issue & Escalation Log (FRPMC04)</a></u> and reported by the PM in the Weekly and Monthly status report as per the <u><a href="#" onclick="changeContent('QMS03PR03')">Project Monitoring and Control (PR03) procedure.</a></u> A copy of the <u><a href='downloads/projectProcedures/FRVER04.xls' download>FRPMC04</a></u> will be forwarded to the Manager - Quality.</p>

  <p><b>14.3.2 Initiation of corrective action</b></p>

<p>The concerned PM will acknowledge the complaint immediately and will analyze the complaint and send a response to the customer within 24 hours about how long it is going to take to resolve particular complaint.</p>

  <p><b>14.3.3 Closure of the complaint</b></p>

<p>The PM will take appropriate actions to close the complaint. The Delivery Head will review the actions prior to submission to the customer. The PM will obtain sign-off from the customer on the complaint resolution. In case the customer does not accept the closure, the PM will record the non-acceptance as a fresh complaint with the description ‘Closure not accepted’.
The Delivery Head will maintain all the complaints received for that account using the <u><a href='downloads/projectProcedures/FRVER04.xls' download>Issue & Escalation Log (FRPMC04).</a></u></p>

  <p><b>14.3.4 Review of Customer complaints</b></p>

<p>The Manager -Quality will consolidate the customer complaints three months. These will be discussed in the Operations Review Meeting to identify Preventive Actions, so that similar problem does not occur once again. At the organisational level the SQA department will identify and monitor the effectiveness of the actions taken.</p>
