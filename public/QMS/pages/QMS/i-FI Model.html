        <p>The basic framework of this model is shown in the fig above where, a software development activity is divided into four different stages: Input, Transform, Verify and Output. These four stages are applied to every work item in the software development
            lifecycle and at the end of a particular work item, the “transformed” item is verified to examine whether it meets the stated and implied quality requirements. If it meets the requirement then it is passed on to the Output stage. If the work
            item fails to meet the requirement then it is looped back to the Transform stage and the process is repeated until the work item meets the requirements. From the output stage a feedback is created to the Input stage as a means of providing
            improvement mechanism to the entire process.</p>

        <p>These six phases are shown in fig-2. The basic development framework (fig-1) is applied to different phases of the development lifecycle leading to a fractal. This ensures quality of the delivered software.</p>
        <p>After the software is delivered, feedback is collected from the customer to identify improvement opportunity in the process. This process model will be followed in all development projects of duration more than eight weeks. For small projects,
            with duration less than eight weeks, the PM can request the EPG for process tailoring. In small projects, at least PMP, CMP, QMP, RMP, SRS, STP, Test Specifications documents will be prepared, reviewed and the review record maintained. The
            PM will ensure that the code is reviewed.</p>

                            <p>Software Requirements also form the basis for determining when the software is complete. The verification of the software functionality against the requirement documents serves to demonstrate that the contractual agreement
                                between the customer and developers has been met and generally implies the end of the development phase. This validation or validation and verification requires the construction of test situations i.e. ATP to objectively
                                prove the software product compliance with the requirement document. The ATP and ATS are prepared and given by the customer. In the event that the customer does not give the ATP and ATS then, the STP and STS would form
                                the basis for acceptance of the software.</p>
