        <p><b>1 Purpose</b></p>
        <p>The document was prepared to understand the Organizational Norms and reporting structure in INTEGRA and the behavioural requirements of the employees in a team.</p>


        <p><b>2.     Organizational Norms and Reporting Structures in Integra </b></p>
        <p>There are multiple Projects at INTEGRA which are headed by multiple different project managers. Their reporting structure is defined in the project organization chart. The project team has specific set of responsibilities like delivery management,
            client communication and people management. The Project Manager is the person responsible for ensuring that the project team completes the project. The Project Manager develops the project plan with the team and manages the team’s performance
            of project tasks.</p>
        <p>It is also the responsibility of the Project Manager to secure acceptance and approval of deliverables from the Project Sponsor and Stakeholders. The Project Team Members who reports to Project manager and are responsible for executing tasks and
            producing deliverables as outlined in the Project Plan and directed by the Project Manager, at whatever level of effort or participation has been defined for them. Some Project Team members may serve as Team Leads, providing task and technical
            leadership, and sometimes maintaining a portion of the project plan.</p>
        <p><b>·        Hierarchy of team –</b> The team is structured in a hierarchical manner where in PM is the highest and team member is lowest. The expectation of this is that decisions pass from to PM to TM while information passes from TM to PM. Further,
            the communication between the team and the customer is H structure and the PM forms the single point of contact (SPOC) for the team.</p>
        <p><b>·        Team capability analysis –</b> In INTEGRA, the teams are structured along verticals such as BFSI, Telecom, Enterprise etc, where in the team skills and capabilities are embedded within the team structure. This means that all the skills
            required to work in the verticals are within the control of the team manager.</p>
