        <b>9.6 Bomb Threats</b>
    </p>
    <p>Bomb threats are delivered in a variety of ways. The majority of threats are called in to the target. Occasionally these calls are through a third party. Sometimes a threat is communicated in writing or by a recording. Two logical explanations for
        reporting a bomb threat are:</p>
    <div class="box-body">
        <ol>
            <li>The caller has definite knowledge or believes that an explosive or bomb has been or will be placed and he/she wants to minimize personal injury or property damage. The caller may be the person who placed the device or someone who has become
                aware of such information.</li>
            <li>The caller wants to create an atmosphere of anxiety and panic which will, in turn, result in a disruption of the normal activities at the premise where the device is purportedly placed.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p>Whatever the reason for the report, there will certainly be a reaction to it. Through proper planning, the wide variety of potentially uncontrollable reactions can be greatly reduced.</p>
    <div class="box-body">
        <ul>
            <li> Bombs being delivered by car or left in a car are a grave reality. Parking should be restricted. If restricted parking is not feasible, properly identified employee vehicles should be parked closest to the facility and visitor vehicles parked
                at a distance.</li>
            <li>Security and maintenance personnel should be alert for people who act in a suspicious manner, as well as objects, items, or parcels which look out of place or suspicious.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Responding to bomb threat</b>
    </p>
    <p>The bomb threat caller is the best source of information about the bomb. When a bomb threat is called in:</p>
    <div class="box-body">
        <ul>
            <li> Keep the caller on the line as long as possible. Ask him/her to repeat the message. Record every word spoken by the person.</li>
            <li> If the caller does not indicate the location of the bomb or the time of possible detonation, ask him/her for this information.</li>
            <li>Inform the caller that the building is occupied and the detonation of a bomb could result in death or serious injury to many innocent people.</li>
            <li> Pay particular attention to background noises, such as motors running, music playing, and any other noise, which may give a clue as to the location of the caller.</li>
            <li> Listen closely to the voice (male, female), voice quality (calm, excited), accents, and speech impediments. Immediately after the caller hangs up, report the threat to the chairman of crisis management team.</li>
            <li>Report the information immediately to the police department, fire department, and other appropriate agencies.</li>
            <li>Remain available, as law enforcement personnel will want to interview you.</li>
