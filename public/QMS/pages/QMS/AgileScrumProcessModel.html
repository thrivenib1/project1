    </div>
    <div id="content">
        <p>Agile Scrum is an iterative, incremental framework for projects and product development. It structures development in cycles of work called <b>Sprints.</b> These iterations are no more than one month each, and take place one after the other. The
            Sprints are time boxed they end on a specific date whether the work has been completed or not, and are never extended.

        <p><b>2.   ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</b></p>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
        <p><b>In Scrum, there are three roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master and Team</b></p>
    </div>
    <div id="centertext1">
        <br/>
        <p><b>a)    Product Owner</b></p>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
        <p>The Product Owner identifies product / application features, translates these into a prioritized list, continually re-prioritizes and refines the list based on interaction with stakeholders (management, delivery head, customer, sales team, etc).
            Ideally the project manager can take up this role.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="centertext1">

        <p><b>b)   Scrum Master</b></p>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
        <p>The Scrum Master makes sure the team understands and follows the practices of Scrum. The scrum master is responsible for resolving any impediments or blocks faced by the team. The team lead can ideally take up this role.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="centertext1">

        <p><b>c)    Team</b></p>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
        <p>The Team builds the product / application that the Product Owner indicates. The Team in Scrum is ?cross-functional? ? it includes all the expertise necessary to deliver the potentially shippable product each Sprint.</p>

        <p><span style="display:inline-block; width: 50px;"></span>&#10147; One by one, each member of the Team reports three things to the other members of the Team: (1) What they were able to get done since the last meeting; (2) what they are planning

        <p><span style="display:inline-block; width: 50px;"></span>&#10147; The Scrum Master notes down any blocks or impediments.</p>

        <p>Note:</p>

        <p><span style="display:inline-block; width: 50px;"></span>1. There is no discussion during the Daily Scrum, only reporting answers to the three questions; if discussion is required it takes place immediately after the Daily Scrum.</p>

        <p><span style="display:inline-block; width: 50px;"></span>2. On update of sprint backlog, the sprint burn down chart gets automatically updated. This graph shows, each day, a new estimate of how much work (measured in person hours) remains until

    <div id="content">
        <p><b>a)     Burn Down</b></p>

        <p>The trend of work remaining across time in a Sprint. The source of the raw data is the Sprint Backlog, with work remaining tracked on the vertical axis and the time periods (days of a Sprint) tracked on the horizontal axis.</p>

        <p><b>b)    Estimated Work Remaining</b></p>

        <p>The numbers of hours that a Team member estimates remain to be worked on any task. This estimate is updated at the end of every day when the Sprint Backlog task is worked on.</p>

        <p><b>c)     Sprint</b></p>

        <p>Iteration, or one repeating cycle of similar work, that produces increment of product or system.</p>

        <p><b>d)    Product Backlog</b></p>

        <p>A prioritized list of requirements with estimated times to turn them into completed product functionality. The list emerges, changing as business conditions or technology changes.</p>

        <p><b>e)     Sprint Backlog</b></p>

        <p>A list of tasks that defines a Team’s work for a Sprint. Each task identifies those responsible for doing the work and the estimated amount of work remaining on the task on any given day during the Sprint.</p>

        <p><b>f)      Stakeholder</b></p>

        <p>A group of people that is responsible for managing themselves to develop an increment of product every Sprint.</p>

        <p>A period of time that cannot be exceeded and within which an event occurs.</p>
