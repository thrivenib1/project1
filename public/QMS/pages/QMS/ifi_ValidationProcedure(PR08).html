                        <li>If UAT is included in the contract, then a customer supplied ATP/ATS should be available. Else, we have to develop the ATP/ATS incorporating the plan and procedure to prove the objectives put down as the criteria for user acceptance in the contract document (PO/SOW).</li>
                        <li>Also develop the <u><a href='downloads/projectProcedures/TPVAL01.doc' download>STP (TPVAL01)</a></u> that will cover the scope, approach, methods of testing, tools, environment, and expectations from different stakeholders, deliverables and closure criteria.</li>
                        <li> Other non-technical aspects such as information security, movement of bonded equipment, client interface, escalation points, etc., will have to be documented in the STP.</li>

                        <li>In case of changes in the requirements during the TLC, a request for change should be logged-in first, get the approval from the TL and then modify the test cases. Review of the modified document is a must with correct closure.</li>

                        <li> Test environment has to be setup based on the testing method. This will include test engineers, product under test, bug logging and tracking software, test management and reporting systems, any other hardware or software that would be required to simulate/emulate components of the test environment in lieu of real-time equipments, connectivity and networking.
