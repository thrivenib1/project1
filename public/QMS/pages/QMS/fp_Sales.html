    <p><b>1.1.1 Purpose </b><br/>The purpose of this procedure is to define the sales process of Integra Micro Software Services Pvt. Ltd. (Referred as IMSSPL). Scope for business with the customer can arise either by the customer or a sales partner asking
        for a Request for Information (RFI) from IMSSPL or by the Sales team of IMSSPL prospecting the potential customer asking for Request for Proposal (RFP) or any other member of IMSSPL. In either case the Sales team tracks the information and records
        it in internal tool <b>Enquiry Management System (EMS).</b> The updates on ongoing enquiries and new enquiries, if any, from the tracker maintained by sales team, are included in MIS Dashboard by the MIS Dashboard team, and the detailed report is shared
        with the top management and other concerned stakeholders like Business Unit (BU), Business Development (BD), HRD, SQA, Finance, and any other stakeholders on a fortnightly/monthly/quarterly basis.</p>

    <p><b>1.1.2 Policy </b><br/>The Sales process will be followed for soliciting requirements from the existing customers and prospects for providing software engineering services, fulfilling requirements and also for the purpose of maintaining relationship
        with the customers.</p>
