    <p><b>4.1.1    Quality system processes</b></p>

    <p>4.1.1.1 The quality management system is designed as a system of interrelated processes. All main activities of the system are defined as Quality System Processes (QSPs) and are grouped into the following two categories:</p>
    <p>• Operational Product Processes (OPP),</p>
    <p>• Operational Functional Processes (OFP).</p>
    <p>These processes are organized into a Plan-Do-Check-Act loop as shown in the process map in figure 1.</p>

    <p>4.1.1.2 The sequence and interrelation between the two groups and individual QSPs are illustrated in the Processes Map diagram. Each QSP is further broken down into its sub-processes.</p>

    <p>4.1.1.3 QSPs and their sub-processes are documented in this quality manual and in associated operational procedures and work instructions. This documentation defines the quality system processes and their sequence and interaction, and instructs on
        how to implement and apply them throughout the organization. </p>
    <p>4.1.1.4 Quality system documentation also defines criteria and methods needed to ensure that the operation and control of quality system processes are effective. This includes assignment of responsibilities and allocation of resources for the process,
        instructions on how to carry out (or operate) the process, and definition of methods for monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of the process.</p>

    <p><b>4.1.2    Resources and information</b></p>
    <p>4.1.2.1 The MR (Management Representative) is responsible for determining resource and information requirements necessary to support the operation and monitoring of quality system processes (QSPs), and for communicating these requirements to the top
        Management. Top Management is responsible for ensuring the availability of necessary resources and information.</p>

    <p><b>4.1.3   Monitoring and measurement</b></p>
    <p>4.1.3.1 Performance of QSP is monitored and measured. This is to ensure their effectiveness and identify opportunities for improvement.</p>
    <p>4.1.3.2 Performance of quality system processes is monitored through internal quality audits.</p>
    <p>4.1.3.3 The overall performance of the quality system is monitored by measuring customer satisfaction.</p>
    <p>4.1.3.4 Quality system processes are reviewed and analyzed by the management review of the quality system.</p>


    <p><b>4.1.4   Continual improvement</b></p>
    <p>4.1.4.1 Quality management system processes are regularly reviewed by the Management to identify any possible failures or breakdowns, as well as opportunities for improvement. Actions necessary to address actual or potential problems and to improve
        the quality system are implemented through corrective and preventive actions and through quality objectives.</p>
    <p>4.1.4.2 QM Section 8.5 and Operational Procedures Management Review and Corrective and Preventive Actions, define how the quality management system itself ensures its own compliance and continual improvement.</p>

    <p><b>4.1.5   Outsourced processes</b></p>
    <p>4.1.5.1 If part of the product or component of the product or services is acquired form a third party supplier then the selection of such supplier will follow the procedure for Purchase FP08.</p>
    <p>4.1.5.2 Even if some part of the product or services might have been outsourced to a supplier, Integra will be responsible for conforming to all customer and other applicable requirements.</p>



    <p><b>4.2 Document and records </b></p>
    <p><b>4.2.1  General</b></p>
    <p>• Integra has defined the Quality Policy and the objectives.</p>
    <p>• The Quality Management System document hierarchy is shown Figure 2 below.</p>

    <br/>
    <br/>

    <p><b>4.2.2  Documentation</b></p>
    <p>4.2.2.1 Integra quality system documentation comprises the following categories of documents:</p>
    <p>• Quality system manual;</p>
    <p>• Quality system operational procedures;</p>
    <p>• Process models</p>
    <p>• Standards and Guidelines</p>
    <p>• Quality system forms;</p>
    <p>• Work aids (Templates and Checklists)</p>
    <p>These categories are further defined in Operational Procedure <b>Control of Documents.</b></p>


    <p><b>4.2.3   Control of documents</b></p>
    <p>4.2.3.1 Integra maintains the Quality Management System document in the electronic format. Control and distribution of the electronic copy of the QMS documents is maintained using configuration management tool CVS and internal tool PCC respectively.
        However, a PDF version of the QMS is maintained in the CVS for distribution to various stakeholders and it is not a controlled copy.</p>
    <p>4.2.3.2 Documents of external origin will be controlled by using the <b>Control of Documents</b> procedure. All such documents will be tracked for updates and latest version will be maintained and followed.</p>
    <p>4.2.3.3 The document control system defined in Operational Procedure Control of Documents ensures that:</p>
    <p>• Documents are reviewed for adequacy and are approved prior to release;</p>
    <p>• Documents are reviewed and updated as necessary, and revised documents are re-approved;</p>
    <p>• Documents are identified, to include their current revision status and changes;</p>
    <p>• Documents are distributed to, and are available at locations where they are used;</p>
    <p>• Document distribution is controlled; and</p>
    <p>• Obsolete documents are withdrawn from points of use, and/or are clearly identified to prevent their unintended use.</p>


    <p><b>4.2.4   Control of records</b></p>
    <p>4.2.4.1 Records are established and maintained to provide evidence of conformity to requirements and of the effective operation of the quality management system.</p>
    <p>4.2.4.2 Records are organized into the following categories:</p>
    <p>• Product/ Service review records,</p>
    <p>• Product/ Service Quality Records</p>
    <p>• Contractual Records</p>

    <p>4.2.4.3 Operational procedure Control of Records defines more specifically what records are maintained in each category and designates their storage locations and retention periods. It also defines the process for ensuring that records are clearly
        identified, are stored in appropriate locations and conditions, are adequately protected, and are easily retrievable.</p>
    <p>4.2.4.4 Retention period and disposal of records is defined in section 2.3.2 of <b>Control of Records</b> procedure.</p>
