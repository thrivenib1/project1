				<p><b>4.4 Task Details </b></p>
				<p><b>4.4.1  Audit Programs </b></p>
				<p>At the beginning of every financial year, the MR defines an audit program spanning the entire financial year. In a year two internal audits with a gap of six months will be conducted. However, if a projectâ€™s lifecycle is less than 6 months, it will be audited once in its lifetime </p>
				<p>The MR will decide the program based on the status of the projects and processes. </p>
				
				<p><b>4.4.2  Prepare Audit Plans </b></p>
				<p>Prepare audit plans for each audit in the audit program using <u><a href="#">Audit Plan (TPOPF03) </a></u>. The following items will be specified in the audit plan:</p>
				<p>The MR will decide the program based on the status of the projects and processes. </p>
				<p> ·   Schedule</p>
				<p> ·   Audit area, Auditee and Auditor.</p>
				<p> ·   Offline verifications to be made (if necessary)</p>
				<p> ·   Reference to previous audit reports.</p>
				<p>This will be necessary if any finding requires a corrective/preventive action to be taken for all the projects or functions across the entire organization.</p>
				
				<p><b>4.4.3  Audit Scope for Each Audit </b></p>
				<p>The MR defines audit scope based on: </p>
				<p> ·   Focus Area (Projects)</p>
				<p> ·   business needs</p>
				<p> ·   the study of previous audit reports</p>
				<p> ·   project specific requirement</p>
				<p> ·   QMS feedback.</p>
				
				<p><b>4.4.4  Review Audit program</b></p>
				<p>Review will happen at 3 levels:</p>
				<p> ·    At the end of the financial year, the MR reviews the entire audit program before defining the audit program for the next year.</p>
				<p> ·    At the end of each audit, the MR reviews the audit and compiles the audit summary report using <u><a href="#">FROPF04</a></u>. The review report/process improvements will be prepared and tracked by SQA.</p>
				<p> ·   Apart from the scheduled reviews, review may also happen on the directive of Top Management. </p>
				
				<p><b>4.4.5  Maintain List of Certified Internal Auditors/ Auditor Experience Database</b></p>
				<p>This list will be prepared based on the criteria defined in the ISO 19011: 2011 standards. The list also may be updated when new employees join the organization based on their audit experience in their previous employments.MR will own and maintain this list. After every audit, the list of certified internal auditors will be updated to indicate the number of Internal Audit conducted by the auditor using <u><a href="#">TPAED01</a></u></p>
				
				<p><b>4.4.6   Selection Criteria for Internal Auditors</b></p>
				<p>Criteria for selecting the internal auditors will be as per the ISO 19011: 2011. Refer to <u><a href="#">Selection Criteria for Internal Auditors (GLOPF01). </a></u></p>
				<p>Internal Auditor Refresher training will be conducted for all the Internal Auditors once in 3 years.</p>
				
				<p><b>4.4.7    Monitoring Effectiveness of Internal Audit</b></p>
				<p>Effectiveness of Internal Audit will be monitored every year. The Internal Auditors will ensure that all the non-conformities raised during an audit are closed on time and that the same NC should not be repeated in subsequent audits.</p>
				
				<p><b>4.4.8    Organize Internal Quality Audits</b></p>
				<p>Internal audits will be organized as per the audit program. MR will be responsible for organizing the internal audits.</p>
								
				<p><b>4.4.9    Conduct Opening and Closing Meetings</b></p>
				<p>The MR /Lead Auditor/Quality Manager will hold an opening meeting before the audit, and a closing meeting after the audit with all the auditors, Delivery Head, PMs and Group Heads. During the opening meeting the scope, objectives and schedule of the audit are discussed. </p>
				<p>During the closing meeting the results of the audit including the areas for improvement and excellent performance in various projects and support function would be discussed.</p>
				
				<p><b>4.4.10    Conduct Audits as per the Audit Plan.</b></p>
				<p>For conducting the audits, the auditors may use the Audit Checklists in the Checklist Manual QM-08. The audit will be conducted in the following two steps:</p>
				<p><b>Documentation adequacy check:</b> The auditors will verify the adequacy of the documented procedures against the requirements of the ISO 9001: 2008 Standards.</p>
				<p><b>Compliance audit:</b> The auditor will verify compliance of the Project / Function with respect to the requirements of Integra QMS, ISO 9001:2008 Standards. The auditor uses the evaluation questionnaire specified for software projects or respective function. During internal quality audits the effectiveness of the corrective actions of earlier audit will be verified.</p>
				
				<p><b>4.4.11    Prepare Non Conformance Reports (NCR and PNCR)</b></p>
				<p>Auditors will prepare <u><a href="#">Non-Conformance Report (FROPF01)</a></u> for the non-conformances found in the audit area. The auditor and auditee will discuss and agree on the proposed corrections, corrective and preventive actions and the planned closure dates. The auditors will also fill the <u><a href="#">Auditors Note (FROPF03)</a></u> where details like the good practices followed in the project, effort spent in the audit activity are recorded.</p>
				<p>Each finding must be supported by evidence or lack of it to term it as non-conformity. </p>
				<p>Each finding can be categorized with a severity level, based on the impact. The following table gives the description of the severity levels:</p>
				
				<table class="table table-bordered">
				<thead>
					<tr>
					  <th>Severity Level</th>
					  <th>Description</th>
					</tr>  
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>1.</td>
						<td>Total violation of a procedure: A defined procedure not practiced (Ex. a project contract not reviewed).</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>2.</td>
						<td>
							<p>Partial non-compliance as per the defined system / process</p>
							<p>(E.g. Project/Quality Plan deficiencies, ineffective configuration management, incomplete SRS.)</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>3.</td>
						<td>Few records incomplete </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>4.</td>
						<td>System / Process improvement needed: Indicates improvements in QMS for effectiveness or prevention of non-conformances.</td>

				<p><b>4.4.12     Prepare Audit Summary Report</b></p>
