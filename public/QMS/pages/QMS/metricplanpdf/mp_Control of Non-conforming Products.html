				<p><b>3.3 Task Details </b></p>
				<p><b>3.3.1 Process </b><br/>All products will undergo release readiness review prior to release. The DH and the QM will participate in release readiness review of the product.</p>
				<p>1. After successful completion of the test phase, the project lead will generate the DN (Delivery Note) and RN (Release Note) using PCC and send them to the PM along with the Installation Pack, User Manual (Optional), Traceability Matrices and the System Test Report.</p>
				<p>2. The SQA team will verify that all deliverables have passed through the required tests and verification processes.</p>
				<p>3. If any non-conformity is detected then the PM will take the responsibility to remove the non-conformity prior to releasing the product to the customer.</p>
				<p>4. The DH and QM will authorize release of the product after review.</p>
				<p><b>3.3.2 Dispositions of non-conforming products </b></p>
				<p>All non-conforming products will be reviewed and one of the following actions will follow:</p>
				
				<p><b>1. Rework</b><p>
				<p>An action of correction that renders the nonconforming product to a status that will meet the specified requirements. The PM will plan for rework and remove the nonconformities form the product and put the product for testing. After successful testing a release readiness review will be called for verification. The DH and QM will approve the release of the product if the non-conformances are removed. </p>
				<p><b>2. Scrap</b><p>
				<p>An action that renders the nonconforming product to a condition which prevents usability of the product in any manner. </p>
				<p><b>3. Salvage</b><p>
				<p>An action that removes usable components, functions, or modules from a completed product for use in subsequent product. The PM will identify the re-usable components and documentation the same. All re-usable components will be sent to the organisational repository with product documents. </p>
				<p>All records of the non-conformance found in the product and subsequent action taken will be maintained as per the Control of records procedure. </p>
