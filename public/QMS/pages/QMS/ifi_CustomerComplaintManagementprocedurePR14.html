	<p>Customer complaint could be sent to the PM directly through email or through any other mode of normal communication with the customer. Customer complaints also come through Customer Satisfaction Survey and the interactions with the sales representative of the project. In any case, the complaint will be recorded using Issue & Escalation Log (FRPMC04) and reported by the PM in the Weekly and Monthly status report as per the Project Monitoring and Control (PR03) procedure. A copy of the FRPMC04 will be forwarded to the Manager - Quality.</p>
