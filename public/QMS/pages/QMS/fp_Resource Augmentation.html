        <b>2.1 Introdution </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2.1.1 Purpose </b>
        <br/>The software services in the IT industry are also provided in the form of consulting services which include resource augmentation (Time and Material, with or without delivery responsibility and preferably onsite at customer premises). The
        outsourced resource augmentation services have become a definite trend being followed by almost all medium to large size companies and the number of resource augmentation opportunities is growing at a steady pace. The resource augmentation services
        enable customers to not only focus and leverage on their core strength like product/ IP building, but also save on overheads such as recruitment, ramp-up/ down, training cost etc which is taken care by the partner company providing resources.
        Typically, resource augmentation engagements are in the areas of software requirement study, design, development, integration, testing, implementation/deployment, lifecycle maintenance, porting, migration, technical publication, localisation,
        project management and other related areas. Generally, the customers pass on such outsourcing opportunities to the partner companies and get these outsourced assignments done by taking software engineer(s) either onsite at their premises or offsite
        at partner companyâ€™s premises. All efforts are made to provide the services as per the agreed terms with the customer.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this document is to define the processes for providing resource augmentation services to customers. The processes are meant to be followed by resource augmentation sales team (RAST) for various activities performed by them at Integra
        Micro Software Services (P) Ltd., Bangalore (IMSSPL).</p>

                contacts.

            <li> The RASH provides the projection of number of engineers to be made available for resource augmentation business based on business target worked out in the beginning of the financial year, on a quarterly/ six monthly/ yearly basis. Moreover,
                BU heads would explore all possible options of taking engineers from external world (direct recruitment and through partners) and/or parent company for specific requirements (mainly back-to-back), if a requirement is not serviceable with

                customer by RAST and processed based on decision taken by the BU head.</li>
            <li>If it is decided that the engineer can be brought back and utilised for other projects/roles, then the same is communicated to the customer and relieving date is worked out. A suitable replacement is provided, if asked for by the customer

        <b>2.4.2 Revenue Loss</b>
        <br/>Revenue loss can happen in the following ways. However, the efforts are made to deploy more number of engineers to mitigate the risk of business loss due to the following. Moreover, all possible options are explored by the BU heads in consultation
        with RAST to minimize attrition to the extent possible.</p>
    <div class="box-body">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Attrition:</b> A deployed engineer resigns and IMSSPL is unable to provide a replacement for the same during the given time frame or if the customer decides not to take a replacement due to other business reasons. In such cases, anything above
                the industry standard of 20 % will be considered as a business loss.</li>
            <li><b>Team Downsizing:</b> The customer decides to send the engineers back for various reasons like business, restructuring, vendor consolidation, project closure/fore closure, customer getting acquired, etc by giving notice as per agreed terms.
            </li>
            <li><b>Performance and Conduct:</b> A deployed engineer is also sent back in case the customer finds his/her performance not up to the mark or if found to have any behavioural issues which do not conform to their business ethics or standards.</li>
            <li> <b>Leave:</b> Engineers also return at times due to medical reasons like accident, ailments requiring long/hospitalised treatments or availing of maternity leave. In all these cases replacements are provided, wherever asked for, with overlap of two
                weeks at no extra cost to the customer during knowledge transition period.</li>

            <li> This process is adapted considering the amount of transactions being handled by RAST in the form of mails from all stakeholders including customers every day.</li>
            <li>RA sales data is transaction based and hence, large numbers of files are created/ modified on daily basis. Since the Doc-Mgr (open source document management tool) and the SVN do not have option of uploading multiple files in one go, it was
                decided to back up the data on external drive to save time.</li>
