    <p><b>4.        Process Description</b></p>
    <p><b>Defining PDP (Project’s Defined Process)</b></p>
    <p>All the Projects executed at INTEGRA shall follow the processes defined as part of the INTEGRA QMS, throughout the life cycle of the Project</p>
    <p>INTEGRA has authorized MR (Management Representative) to make the necessary changes to the QMS (OSP) and is the custodian of all the process assets of INTEGRA. The process changes are defined and recommended by the SEPG.</p>
    <p>Based on Project requirements the processes, methodologies, standards, guidelines and checklists may be tailored using the tailoring guidelines.</p>
    <p>All the Projects of INTEGRA should follow the below mentioned processes with necessary tailoring as appropriate. Also, these processes are supported by other process assets such as templates, forms, and guidelines. Project should use these process
        assets.
