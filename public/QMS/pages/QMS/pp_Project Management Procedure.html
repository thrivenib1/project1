                                <p><b>17.1.1 Purpose<br/></b>The purpose of Project Management is to establish and maintain project plans that define project activities, track project progress, take corrective action when the performance deviates from the target, integrate relevant stakeholders according to an integrated process, form and sustain an integrated team for the development of work products.</p>
                                
                                <p><b>17.1.2 Policy (Plan the Process, and Establish a Defined Process (GP2.1, GP 2.2 and GP3.1))</b><br/></p>
                                <p>The organization is committed to using the best practices of Project Management to achieve the organization’s strategic plan. Project Management processes include initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, controlling and closing project activities to successfully satisfy Customer requirements.</p>
                
                <p>The organization expects that every project establish and use a project defined process from the start of the project to the close of the project. The project’s defined process is used to manage the project and collaborate with Stakeholders. Every project will create a project plan to record the activities associated with the project defined process.</p>
                
                <p>Integrated Project Management will be used to coordinate and collaborate with stakeholders throughout the life of the product or deliverable to better satisfy Customer needs, expectations and requirements.</p>
                
                <p>The performance of the project will be monitored against the project plan and corrective actions are required when the performance results deviate from the plan. Project monitoring and controlling activities will be described in the project plan.</p>
                
                <p>The specific practice of “Establish and Maintain Project’s Defined Process” in Integrated Project Management (IPM) will support and implement the generic practice “Establish a Defined Process).</p> 
                                
                                <p><b>17.1.3 Scope</b><br/>The project management procedure encompasses the following CMMI process areas: Project Planning, Project Monitoring and Control, Integrated Project Management for Integrated Teaming</p>

                  <li>   For change requests, document the change requested, along with priority of the change, (optional) approaches to handle the change and workaround if the change is not implemented. Enter change request into the change tracking system or/and change request template. Review the change request. Estimate the impact of the change on the project effort, cost, schedule, resources.  Using the estimate, decide whether or not to authorize the change. If the change is denied, communicate that decision to the requestor and terminate this process. Incorporate the change into the project work plan and adjust resources and schedule as needed, to accommodate the change. Perform the work needed to address the change, and conduct the associated verification activities to ensure correctness. Update change request records to document the changes made and the completion status. Communicate completion status to the Change Control Board. Inform the requestor of the final status.</li>
                 
                  <li>    Determine what kinds of information need to be exchanged. Decide what medium of communication is best – meeting, electronic exchange, other. Determine frequency of communication. Identify the stakeholders who will need to receive the information. Communicate status information, current action items, issues, risks, and status of technical activities.</li>
                 
                  <li>    The Project Manager and the Configuration Management team member will accept items for configuration management as planned after checking if they meet the conditions set by the project and by organization processes for configuration management.

                 <li>     On reaching milestone, event, or date for review, the Project Manager identifies information that needs to be prepared and/or presented. Identify participants for the review. Establish tasks and assignments for the review. Establish review logistics.  Prepare information for the review, including items such as list of accomplishments in last period, list of plans for next period, milestone progress reports (planned to actual), staffing profile (planned to actual), cost profile (planned to actual), size and critical computer resources (if appropriate), risk management status, issues, impacts, and action items status, quality assurance status , configuration management status, requirements management status, updated cost-benefit analysis, and milestones being met as planned. Document the results, action-items and decisions of the review meeting.</li>
                 
                 <li>     The Project Manager determines that a significant change in the plan is needed. Changes can include life cycle approach, effort variance, schedule variance, change in requirements, or an alternate approach to the work, and tools and methods to be used are different from what was initially planned. Develop updates to project plan and review with all affected parties. The DH approves the updated plan.  Establish commitments to the approved plan. Place the updated plan under configuration management.</li>
