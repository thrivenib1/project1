        <p><b>1.2 INTRODUCTION </b></p>
        <p>The QMS documents have been developed with the following objectives:</p>
        <p>a) To communicate Integra's Quality Policy and Quality Procedures across the organization.</p>
        <p>b) To describe and implement an effective Quality Management System.</p>
        <p>c) To provide a documented basis for auditing the Quality Management System.</p>

        <p>1.2.1 Integra has developed and implemented a quality management system to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide product that meets customer and regulatory requirements, and to address customer satisfaction through the effective application
            of the system, including continual improvement and the prevention of nonconformity.</p>

        <p>1.2.2 The quality system complies with the international standards: </p>
        <p>a) ISO 9001:2008 </p>
        <p>b) ISO 19011:2011</p>

        <p>1.2.3 The manual is divided into eight sections just like the sectional organization of the ISO 9001:2008 standard. Sections are further divided into several subsections representing main quality system processes. Each subsection defines general
            policies and basic principles for the pertinent quality system process; summarizes responsibilities and methods; and references relevant operational procedures and other documents.</p>
        <p>1.2.4 The purpose of this manual is to define and describe the quality system, to define authorities and responsibilities of the management personnel involved in the operation of the system, and to provide a general description of all processes
            comprising the quality system.</p>
        <p>1.2.5 Another purpose of this manual is to present the quality system to customers, suppliers, regulators and other external interested parties, and to inform them what specific controls are implemented at Integra to assure quality.</p>


        <p><b>1.3  APPLICATION</b></p>
        <p>The Quality Management System will be applied to the following development centers of Integra:</p>
