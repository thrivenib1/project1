        <div id="content">
            <p>Any comprehensive software is expected to be user-friendly across the globe. Localizing the software into multiple languages and creating technical documentation for the software are inherent parts of software development. Integra has been
                involved very actively with various IT companies across the globe, in Localization and technical documentation for various SW applications. Hence, a life cycle model, called <b>i-LANG model, (Integra Language Model)</b> is developed to
                carry out such activities.</p>

        <div id="content">
            <p>The basic framework of this model is shown in the figure above. This model will be applicable for both localization and documentation activities.</p>

            <p>The development framework has four stages: <b>Input, Transform, Verify</b> and <b>Output.</b> Every work item goes through these four stages. The input is processed, and the “transformed” item is verified to examine whether it meets the implicit
                and explicit requirements. If it meets the requirement, it is passed to the Output stage; else, it is looped back to the Transform stage. This process is repeated until the work item meets the quality requirements. From the Output stage,
                a feedback is sent to the Input stage to improve the process.</p>

            <p>The lifecycle is divided into five phases;</p>

            <p><span style="display:inline-block; width: 50px;"></span><b>1.     Requirement,</b></p>

            <p><span style="display:inline-block; width: 50px;"></span><b>2.     Analysis and Design,</b></p>

            <p><span style="display:inline-block; width: 50px;"></span><b>3.     Development,</b></p>

            <p><span style="display:inline-block; width: 50px;"></span><b>4.     Verification and</b></p>

            <p><span style="display:inline-block; width: 50px;"></span><b>5.     Delivery.</b></p>

            <p>These fives phases are shown in Fig – 2. In each phase, the basic development framework (Figure –1) is applied. This model provides the same basic framework for technical writing as well as localization activities. The way the model is applied
                in each case, for each phase is explained in the following sections.</p>

            <p>The Revision History section in the SPMP will reflect the revisions made in the SPMP, and all the revisions require approval from the same authorities that reviewed and approved the earlier version of the plan.</p>

            <p>If the multiple cycles of work needs to be carried out under the same project the PM will update the schedule and effort section of the SPMP and get approval of the same.</p>

            <p>The requirement document contains all the requirements of the project. It communicates the customer’s needs, wishes, and expectations.</p>

            <p>The requirement document forms the basis for determining whether the developed system is complete. The verification of the system against the requirement document serves to demonstrate that the contractual agreement between the customer and
                Integra has been met, and generally implies the end of the development phase. This verification requires the construction of test situations i.e. ATP to objectively prove the system compliance with the requirements specified.</p>

            <p>All requirements identified during the Analysis phase are documented in the Requirements Specification (RS). The main elements of an RS are: List of deliverables, list of languages to be localized into, and translation guidelines and glossary
                lists to be used (if any)</p>

            <p>Re-estimation is also carried out whenever there is any change request, either from the customer’s side or by the project team itself. The SPMP is modified to include all the affects arising out of re-estimation. The same person that approved
                the earlier version of the SPMP approves it once again, and the revision history is updated in the document.</p>

            <p>Checklists are prepared for checking the correctness and completeness of the project work item. Generic checklists are reviewed and improved to cater to the needs of the specific project. Special checklists also can be created to verify adherence
