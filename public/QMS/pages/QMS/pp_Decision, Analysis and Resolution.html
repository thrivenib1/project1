                                <p><b>16.1.1 Purpose</b><br/>The purpose of this process is to define the steps required to plan and conduct a formal evaluation and decision making.  A formal evaluation process may be used at any point in the life-cycle of a project[1] or execution of any other work whenever a formal decision is needed, for example COTS evaluation and selection. The activities involved in this process are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>       Establishing the criteria for evaluating alternatives</li>
                
                                  <li>       Identifying alternative solutions</li>
                
                                    <li>        Selecting methods for evaluating alternatives</li>
                
                <li>       Evaluating the alternative solutions using the established criteria and methods</li>
                
                <li>        Selecting recommended solutions from the alternatives based on the evaluation criteria</li>
                                </ul>

                             <p>Criteria for determining when to use formal evaluation include the following:</p>
                             <p>a)     When there is a clear definition of an issue requiring a decision</p>
                <p>b)     When there is a reasonable assumption that more than 1 valid option exists</p>
