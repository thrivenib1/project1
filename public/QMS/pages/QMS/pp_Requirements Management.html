                    <p>The prime purpose of the REQM processes is as follows:</p>

                          <ul>

                    <li>To identify inconsistencies between those requirements and the project’s plans and work products.</li>
                    <li>To formally manage any change requirements.</li>

                    <p><b>1.1.2 Policy </b><br/>The REQM process is to be referred to and followed for obtaining and managing requirements throughout the project lifecycle of any type of project/service provided within the organisation.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>1.1.3 Scope</b><br/>Within the duration of the project, REQM is used after the complete initial requirements are defined and mutually agreed upon by the authorised requirements provider and requirements receiver. Thereafter REQM defines how the evolving and additional new requirements are managed and consistency is retained till the end of the project.</p>
                    <p>This process is applicable to all projects/services within the organization.</p>

                        <li>Both forward and backward traceability of requirements is essential for effective requirements management. To ensure this the following tasks need to be carried out.</li>				
                        <li>The PM and Architect will prepare a RTM using <u><a href='downloads/projectProcedures/TPREQ02.xls' download>TPREQ02</a></u> to ensure the bi-directional traceability between URS, SRS, Design, Code and test artefacts.</li>
                        <li>When a change request is received and accepted, the RTM in all the above artefacts is updated as required.</li>
