    <div class="box-body">
        <ul>
            <li>Use strong passwords. Choose passwords that are difficult or impossible to guess. Give different passwords to all other accounts.</li>

            <li> Make regular back-up of critical data. Back-up must be made at least once in each day. Larger organizations should perform a full back-up weekly and incremental back-up every day. At least once in a quarter the back-up media should be verified.
            </li>

            <li> Use Antivirus software and update regularly.</li>
