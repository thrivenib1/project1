        <p>9.4.2.4. The following paragraphs specify the incident management plan requirements. These requirements are in compliance with relevant Organization policies and standards.</p>

        <p>9.4.2.5. Incident Management process is established taking into the following considerations:</p>
        <div class="box-body">
            <ol>
                <li>Incident Management Training: The Organization ISMS MR should provide incident management training to the users on how to identify and report security incidents.</li>

                <li> Identifying and Prioritizing Types of Incidents: The Organisation ISMS MR will develop and maintain guidelines for identifying and prioritizing security incidents. Organization Employees designated by agreement or assignment should evaluate
                    the potential for the occurrence of certain types of incidents and prioritize them.</li>

                <li> Incident Monitoring: The Organization ISMS MR should develop and maintain guidelines on how to monitor for security incidents. The organization employees designated by agreement or assignment, as part of their risk management program,
                    should continuously monitor for security incidents (both physical and IT related incidents) per the guidelines listed above.</li>

                <li> Incident Detection: The Organization ISMS MR should develop and maintain enterprise-wide procedures for collecting, analysing and reporting data. The integrity of all data relating to criminal acts must be preserved as possible evidence
                    and will be collected using generally accepted forensic procedures. The forensic procedures to be followed will be developed and disseminated by the Organization ISMS MR.</li>

                <li> Incident Reporting: The Organization ISMS MR should define the basic procedure to be followed for reporting incidents. The procedure should be expanded upon by the Organization as necessary to include the internal communications and escalation
                    procedures that will be used. The Organization ISMS MR is responsible for reporting the incidents to the management within 24 hours of receiving the report. A manual form may be completed and forwarded to the IT head for processing.
                    An incident reporting template is Available with the ISMS MR and IT team. Incidents observed by any employee should be reported in the following Manner to the IT team / representatives nominated by ISMS MR:</li>
                <div class="box-body">
                    <ul>
                        <li> Email</li>

                        <li> Ticketing Tool</li>

                        <li> Phone Call</li>

                        <li> Verbal</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>The IT Team, should record this information in the Incident Register.</p>

                <li> ISMS Core team: The Organization Top Management has established and utilizes an ISMS Core team. The ISMS MR will work with a cross-functional ISMS Core team that will handle a variety of incidents. The roles and responsibilities of the
                    team will be clearly defined. The team should be adequately staffed and trained to handle the incident(s). Since incidents may be far-reaching, requiring expertise or authority that does not reside within a division/office, the ISMS
                    Core team may include outsourced vendors, internal and external entities, as well as other key facility/agency personnel.</li>

                <li> Organization Protocols: Security incidents may occur across network boundaries. The Organization ISMS MR should define the protocols for handling these incidents and the contacts between Organization Offices, state agencies and outsourced
                    entities.
                </li>

                <li> Impact Assessment: The Organization ISMS MR should evaluate the impact of security incidents. Assessments may be required at various stages of the incident life cycle to assist management in deploying the proper risk management strategy.</li>

                <li> Incident Handling and Escalation Procedures: The Organization ISMS MR should develop and maintain the primary procedures for handling the containment, eradication and recovery aspects of incidents and the guidelines for development of
                    an escalation procedure. The Organization Divisions/Offices should develop escalation procedures that are tailored to their individual circumstances.</li>

                <li> Documentation: All security incidents should be thoroughly documented by the Organization Divisions/Offices with as much detail as possible to describe the incident; time discovered and impacted area for subsequent investigation. The incident
                    report should indicate who was notified and what actions were taken. The Organization ISMS MR may be called on to assist in the documentation process.</li>

                <li> Record Retention: IT team should maintain the incident logs and corresponding documentation for a minimum of one (1) year following the discovery of an incident or until an investigation is completed. Incident logs should be stored in
                    a secure location.</li>

                <li> Post-Incident Analysis: The post-incident analysis provides feedback to improve the existing process and its related procedures. Following actions taken to resolve each security incident, an analysis should be performed by the Organization
                    ISMS MR and the impacted division or office, with assistance of their affiliated staff designated by agreement or assignment, to evaluate the procedures taken and what further steps could have been taken to minimize the impact of the
                    incident. The Incident should be analysed through the investigation process.</li>

                <li> Emergency Planning: If an incident occurs that impacts the safety of citizens, personnel, Organization facilities or results in a situation where agency services are interrupted for an extended period, the incident may be declared an emergency.
                    The Organization ISMS MR should work with the Organization Emergency Response Team to provide guidelines regarding the criteria for identifying an emergency and notification procedures. The Organization Offices should develop the appropriate
                    procedures for identifying and declaring emergencies using the established Organization Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Policy.</li>

                <li> Media Relations: Serious security incidents that are likely to result in media attention should be reported immediately to the Organization Top Management for External Public / Media / Statutory Communications.</li>

                <li> Collection of evidence: Knowledge gained from analysing and resolving information security incidents should be used to reduce the likelihood or impact of future incidents.</li>

                <li> Collected evidence: ISMS MR should ensure that</li>
