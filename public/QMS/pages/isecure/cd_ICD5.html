                        different security policies may be in place, some covering publicly accessible information and some covering sensitive or confidential information. Other times a boundary is defined by a security policy that governs a specific

                        detection system combine to increase the work-factor an attacker must expend to successfully attack the system. Add good password controls and adequate user training to improve the system�s security posture even more.<br/> By using
                        multiple, overlapping protection approaches, the failure or circumvention of any individual protection approach will not leave the system unprotected. Through user training and awareness, well-crafted policies and procedures, and
                        redundancy of protection mechanisms, layered protections enable effective protection of information technology for the purpose of achieving mission objectives.<br/> The need for layered protections is especially important when

                    <td>The concept of limiting access, or "least privilege," is simply to provide no more authorizations than necessary to perform required functions. This is perhaps most often applied in the administration of the system. Its goal is to
                        reduce risk by limiting the number of people with access to critical system security controls (i.e., controlling who is allowed to enable or disable system security features or change the privileges of users or programs). Best
                        practice suggests it is better to have several administrators with limited access to security resources rather than one person with "super user" permissions. .<br/> Consideration should be given to implementing role-based access
                        controls for various aspects of system use, not only administration. The system security policy can identify and define the various roles of users or processes. Each role is assigned those permissions needed to perform its functions.<br/>                        Each permission specifies a permitted access to a particular resource (such as "read" and "write" access to a specified file or directory, "connect" access to a given host and port, etc.). Unless permission is granted explicitly,
                        the user or process should not be able to access the protected resource. Additionally, identify the roles/responsibilities that, for security purposes, should remain separate (this is commonly termed �separation of duties�).</td>

                        the goals of confidentiality and integrity by preventing unauthorized file access. If file encryption is a necessary part of accomplishing the goals, then the mechanism is appropriate. However, if these security goals are adequately

                        systems processing the data. This principle argues for moving away from the traditional practice of creating separate LANs and infrastructures for various sensitivity levels (e.g., security classification or business function such
                        as proposal development) and moving toward solutions that enable the use of common, shared, infrastructures with appropriate protections at the operating system, application, and workstation level. Moreover, to accomplish missions
                        and protect critical functions, organizations have many types of information to safeguard. With this principle in mind, system engineers, architects, and IT specialists should develop a security capability that allows organizations
