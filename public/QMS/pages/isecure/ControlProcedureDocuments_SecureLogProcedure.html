        <p>The purpose of this documented information is to provide an overview of the various policies. The required policies to be adhered in all processes preserve the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the information system of the organization.
            Applicable to all activities, personnel performing the activities, personnel responsible for the activity to be performed in the defined manner covering the scope of activities at organization.</p>

        <p>Please refer to <a href="#">ISM01_ IS01_03_T&D </a>document for appropriate terms and their definition.</p>

        <p><b>5.3.1.    Primary Responsibility:</b>ISMS Core Team, Process Heads</p>
        <p><b>5.3.2.    Contributory Responsibility:</b>ISMS MR</p>
        <p><b>5.4.    Procedure</b></p>
        <p><b>5.4.1.    General</b></p>
        The procedure for information security defined below has been approved by management for publication and communication to employees along with relevant external parties.
        <p><b>5.4.2.    Secure Logon</b></p>
        <p>5.4.2.1. All access to the information processing systems on should be controlled via credential authentication logon enabled system</p>

        <p>5.4.2.2. Secure log on systems should be enabled through unique user id and correlating passwords.</p>

        <p>5.4.2.3. The unique user id should be allocated individual wise or process wise or machine wise</p>

        <p>5.4.2.4. System/application identifiers should not be displayed until the logon procedure has been successfully completed.</p>

        <p>5.4.2.5. A 'pop-up' window or prime-screen acceptable use warning that the workstation should only be accessed by authorized users. This will not stop determined unauthorized users; however, it does show that the organization has demonstrated
            that the system is not freely available and that unauthorized use may contravene the Computer Misuse.</p>

        <p>5.4.2.6. Systems should be configured to not indicate which part of the logon information is incorrect e.g. if a user makes an error. This ensures to prevent unauthorized users identifying patterns when attempting to gain access to systems.</p>

        <p>5.4.2.7. System should limit the number of unsuccessful consecutive logon attempts. Systems should allow limited unsuccessful attempts before locking users out. A pop-up window should then advise the user to contact a helpdesk to have the password
            reset. The system can also be set to record unsuccessful logons (useful to identify frequency of errors and to alert of a possible hacking attempt).</p>

        <p>5.4.2.8. The system should record the date and time of successful logons. Logs may be used during investigations. The log is therefore a valuable source of evidence and should be linked to a workstation identity (the Media Access Control (MAC)
            address will be needed to do this).</p>

        <p>5.4.2.9. The password being entered should not be displayed in clear text. Most systems show several asterisk characters and some systems nothing at all in the password field.</p>

        <p>5.4.2.10. Passwords should not be transmitted in clear text over the network. Passwords should be encrypted transmission over networks.</p>

        <p>5.4.2.11. Systems should enforce password changes after a specified period correlating to the organization password management policy.</p>

        <p>5.4.2.12. All secure log on systems data should comply to the policy for the management of secret authentication information of users established in the organization.</p>
