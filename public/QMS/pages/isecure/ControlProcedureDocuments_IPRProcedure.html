        <p>10.4.2.4. Most of the software titles on organization's current software list are not freeware; therefore, the cost of software is a consideration for most titles and their deployment.</p>

        <p>10.4.2.5. It is the goal of the IT department to keep licensing accurate and up to date. To address this, the IT department is responsible for purchasing software licenses for the following software categories:</p>
        <div class="box-body">
            <ul>
                <li> Desktop operating system software</li>

                <li>Internet software</li>

                <li> Accessories</li>

                <li> The other software categories (workgroup-specific titles) are the purchasing responsibility of the workgroup in which they serve. However, the application(s) are still installed and supported by the IT department.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>10.4.2.6. To control costs, licensing costs are a factor in the decision-making processes that go into client software planning and request approval.</p>

        <p>10.4.2.7. If a user is to request software for their computer, the proper method will be to send a request to the IT manager.</p>

        <p>10.4.2.8. A response is guaranteed within one business day via e-mail. If the Urgent option is selected or an in-person appearance occurs, a solution may be delivered at the first possible time. All in-person or ''walk-in'' requests are logged
            by a manual entry into the support request system to track licensing needs and costs.</p>

        <p>10.4.2.9. When operating platforms are changed, business critical applications are reviewed and tested to ensure there is no adverse impact on organizational operations or security.</p>

        <p>10.4.2.10. Modifications to software packages are discouraged, limited to necessary changes and all changes shall be strictly controlled, by only IT Team in the organization, through permission by ISMS MR.</p>
